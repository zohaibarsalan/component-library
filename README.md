# Component Library

This is a custom component library that suits my needs. Right now this is a side project different from what I work on the daily basis and something that I'll update very slowly.

The components will be styled in Tailwind CSS, but there will be standardized and have a unique look to them. This is made for me personally and will focus on my aesthetics.

I couldn't think of a name right now that's why it is what it is.
